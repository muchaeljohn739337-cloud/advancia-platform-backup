## Deployment Considerations

### Environment Variables Required

```bash
# Security Keys
ENCRYPTION_KEY=<32-character-key>
JWT_SECRET=<secure-jwt-secret>

# Redis Configuration (Production)
REDIS_URL=<redis-connection-url>

# Environment Detection
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Production Checklist

-   [ ] Environment variables configured
-   [ ] Redis instance available
-   [ ] SSL/TLS certificates installed
