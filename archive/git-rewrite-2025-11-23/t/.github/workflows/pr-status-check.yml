          echo "This PR must pass the pre-deploy check workflow before merging."

# To enforce this, go to GitHub repo Settings > Branches > Branch protection rules
# - Add a rule for 'main'
# - Require status checks to pass before merging
# - Select 'Render Pre-Deploy' (or your pre-deploy workflow name)
#
# For PR labels, use GitHub's built-in label system or a bot (e.g., 'ready-to-merge' only after checks pass).
# See backend/README.render.md for more details.
