# Notes:
# - This job uses the GitHub Environment `production`. Configure environment protection
#   (Settings -> Environments -> production) to require reviewers/approvals before this
#   workflow runs the deploy step.
# - Ensure repository secrets `RENDER_API_KEY` and `RENDER_SERVICE_ID` are set.
