## 🚀 Running the Tests

### Option 1: Run Entire Collection

1. Click on the collection name
2. Click "Run" button
3. In Collection Runner:
   - Select your environment
   - Click "Run Advancia Lockout Tests"
4. Watch the results in real-time

### Option 2: Run Individual Requests

Execute requests one-by-one in this order:

1. **Health Check** - Verify backend is running
2. **Admin Login (Valid TOTP)** - Test successful authentication
3. **Failed Login Attempts 1-5** - Simulate lockout trigger
4. **Verify Lockout** - Confirm lockout persists
5. **Admin Login (Backup Code)** - Test recovery (after unlocking)
6. **Get Users** - Test JWT-protected endpoint

---

## 📊 Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Successful Login with TOTP

**Request:** `2. Admin Login (Valid TOTP)`

**Prerequisites:**

1. Account must not be locked
2. Get current TOTP code from Google Authenticator
3. Update `validTOTP` environment variable

**Expected Response:**

```json
{
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
  "user": {
    "id": 1,
    "email": "admin@advancia.com",
    "role": "admin"
  }
}
```

**Status Code:** `200 OK`

**Postman Test Results:**

- ✅ Status code is 200
- ✅ Response has token
- ✅ JWT token saved to environment
- ✅ Response has user data

**Database Verification:**

```powershell
.\quick-db-check.ps1 last-login
```

**Expected DB State:**

```
failed_attempts: 0
last_login_at: [recent timestamp]
locked_until: NULL
```

---

### Scenario 2: Trigger Lockout (5 Failed Attempts)

**Requests:** `3. Failed Login Attempt 1-5`

**Process:**

1. Run "Failed Login Attempt 1" → `401 Unauthorized`
2. Run "Failed Login Attempt 2" → `401 Unauthorized`
3. Run "Failed Login Attempt 3" → `401 Unauthorized`
4. Run "Failed Login Attempt 4" → `401 Unauthorized`
5. Run "Failed Login Attempt 5" → `429 Too Many Requests` or `401 Unauthorized`

**Expected Responses:**

**Attempts 1-4:**

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "error": "Invalid credentials"
}
```

**Status Code:** `401 Unauthorized`

**Attempt 5 (or 6):**

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "error": "Too many login attempts, try again later."
}
```

**Status Code:** `429 Too Many Requests`

**Database Verification After Each Attempt:**

```powershell
.\quick-db-check.ps1 attempts
```

**Expected DB Progression:**

- After attempt 1: `failed_attempts = 1`
- After attempt 2: `failed_attempts = 2`
- After attempt 3: `failed_attempts = 3`
- After attempt 4: `failed_attempts = 4`
- After attempt 5: `failed_attempts = 5, locked_until = [15 min future]`

---

### Scenario 3: Verify Lockout Persists

**Request:** `4. Verify Lockout (With Correct Password)`

**Process:**

1. After triggering lockout, run this request
2. Uses CORRECT password and valid TOTP
3. Should still be rejected

**Expected Response:**

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "error": "Too many login attempts, try again later."
}
```

**Status Code:** `429 Too Many Requests`

**Key Point:** Even with valid credentials, login is blocked during lockout period!

**Database Verification:**

```powershell
.\quick-db-check.ps1 lockout
```

**Expected DB State:**

```
failed_attempts: 5
locked_until: [timestamp in future]
lock_status: LOCKED
minutes_remaining: ~15
```

---

### Scenario 4: Unlock and Test Backup Code

**Prerequisites:**

1. Account must be unlocked (wait 15 min OR run `.\quick-db-check.ps1 reset`)
2. Need a plain-text backup code (not the hashed version in DB)

**Request:** `5. Admin Login (Backup Code)`

**Environment Setup:**
Set `backupCode` variable to one of your backup codes

**Expected Response (Success):**

```json
{
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
  "user": {
    "id": 1,
    "email": "admin@advancia.com",
    "role": "admin"
  }
}
```

**Status Code:** `200 OK`

**Expected Response (Still Locked):**

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "error": "Too many login attempts, try again later."
}
```

**Status Code:** `429 Too Many Requests`

**Database Verification After Successful Backup Code Login:**

```powershell
.\quick-db-check.ps1 backup
```

**Expected DB State:**

```
backup_codes_count: 4 (one less!)
failed_attempts: 0 (reset)
last_login_at: [recent timestamp]
```

**Important:** Backup codes are single-use! Once used, they're removed from the database.

---

### Scenario 5: Test Protected Endpoint

**Request:** `6. Get Users (Protected Endpoint)`

**Prerequisites:**

- Must have valid JWT token from successful login
- Token is automatically set in environment after login

**Expected Response (With Valid Token):**

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "email": "admin@advancia.com",
    "role": "admin"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "role": "user"
  }
]
```

**Status Code:** `200 OK`

**Expected Response (Without Token):**

```json
{
  "error": "No token provided"
}
```

**Status Code:** `401 Unauthorized`

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

### Issue: validTOTP always fails

**Problem:** TOTP codes expire every 30 seconds

**Solution:**

1. Open Google Authenticator
2. Get fresh 6-digit code
3. Quickly update `validTOTP` in Postman environment
4. Run request immediately

**Alternative:** Use backup code instead of TOTP

---

### Issue: Account stays locked

**Problem:** Lockout period hasn't expired yet

**Solution:**

```powershell
# Check remaining time
.\quick-db-check.ps1 lockout

# Manual unlock for testing
.\quick-db-check.ps1 reset
```

---

### Issue: "No token provided" error

**Problem:** JWT token not set in environment

**Solution:**

1. Run a successful login request first
2. Check environment variables to see if `jwtToken` was set
3. If not set, manually copy token from login response to environment

---

### Issue: Backup code doesn't work

**Problem:** Backup codes in database are bcrypt hashes, not plain text

**Solution:**

1. Backup codes need to be generated and saved during admin user creation
2. Currently, you need the plain-text codes from initial seeding
3. Alternative: Generate new backup codes via admin API endpoint (future enhancement)

---

## 📚 Integration with Other Tools

### Use with Database Monitoring

```powershell
# Before running Postman tests
.\quick-db-check.ps1 reset

# Run Postman Collection
