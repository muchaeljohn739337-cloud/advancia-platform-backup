# 📈 Post‑Launch Feature Rollout Priorities

## 🔹 Week 1: Core Authentication & Security

- Harden **signup/login** flows (JWT, bcrypt, role‑based access).
- Add **rate limiting** on auth endpoints.
- Enable **Cloudflare WAF + Bot Fight Mode**.
- Implement **audit logs** for compliance.

👉 Why first? Without secure auth, everything else is exposed. This is the foundation.

---

## 🔹 Week 2: Payments & Transactions

- Integrate **Stripe** for subscriptions/payments.
- Add **Plaid** for bank linking (if needed).
- Build **transaction history API**.
- Handle **webhooks** for payment events (success, failure, refunds).

👉 Why second? Payments = revenue. You want billing solid before scaling users.

---

## 🔹 Week 3: Dashboard & User Experience

- Build **responsive React dashboard** (Next.js + Tailwind/MUI).
- Add **charts/analytics** (Chart.js/Recharts).
- Implement **user profile & settings**.
- Add **notifications** (toast + email).
- Optional: **dark mode toggle**.

👉 Why third? Once users can log in and pay, they need a polished dashboard to stay engaged.

---

## 🔹 Week 4: Monitoring & Ops

- Connect **Sentry DSN** (frontend/backend).
- Enable **Datadog agent** for performance metrics.
- Review **DigitalOcean Monitoring** (CPU, memory, disk).
- Centralize logs (ELK stack or Datadog).
- Run **backup automation** for PostgreSQL.

👉 Why fourth? Monitoring ensures you catch issues before users do.

---

## 🔹 Week 5+: Enhancements

- Multi‑tenancy support (B2B SaaS).
- Email service (SendGrid/Resend).
- File uploads (S3‑compatible storage).
- Kubernetes migration plan (for scaling).
- Zero Trust security (Cloudflare Access for admin routes).

---

# ✅ Outcome

By pacing rollout this way:

- You **secure the foundation** first (auth/security).
- You **unlock revenue** next (payments).
- You **delight users** with dashboards.
- You **protect uptime** with monitoring.
- You **scale smartly** with enhancements later.

# 🔧 Adaptations for Advvancia’s Ops & Feature Roadmap

## 📍 Add Milestones

- **Milestone 1: Secure Foundation** → Auth, SSL, WAF, audit logs
- **Milestone 2: Monetization** → Stripe/Plaid integration, invoices, webhooks
- **Milestone 3: User Delight** → Dashboard, analytics, notifications, dark mode
- **Milestone 4: Reliability** → Monitoring, backups, CI/CD pipeline
- **Milestone 5: Scale** → Multi‑tenancy, Kubernetes, Zero Trust

👉 Milestones give you clear checkpoints instead of just tasks.

---

## 🔗 Add Dependencies

- Auth must be **complete before payments** (Stripe needs secure user accounts).
- Payments must be **stable before dashboards** (users expect billing data in UI).
- Monitoring should be **in place before scaling** (you need visibility before growth).

👉 Dependencies prevent wasted effort and ensure logical sequencing.

# 🔗 Dependency Map (Execution Flow)

**Auth & Security → Payments → Dashboard → Monitoring → Scale**

- **Auth & Security**
  - JWT login/signup
  - Rate limiting
  - Cloudflare WAF + Bot Fight Mode
  - Audit logs  
    ⬇️ (must be complete before payments)

- **Payments**
  - Stripe integration
  - Plaid bank linking
  - Webhooks for billing events  
    ⬇️ (depends on secure auth)

- **Dashboard**
  - User profile & settings
  - Charts & analytics
  - Notifications  
    ⬇️ (depends on payments data)

- **Monitoring**
  - Sentry error tracking
  - Datadog performance metrics
  - DigitalOcean monitoring
  - Backup automation  
    ⬇️ (needed before scaling)

- **Scale**
  - Multi‑tenancy support
  - Kubernetes migration plan
  - Zero Trust security
  - Cost optimization

⚡ This map makes it clear: **secure first, monetize second, delight users third, protect uptime fourth, scale last**.

## 🔹 Breakdown
- **Auth & Security** → must be complete before payments (JWT, bcrypt, WAF, audit logs).  
- **Payments** → depends on secure auth (Stripe, Plaid, webhooks).  
- **Dashboard & UX** → depends on payments data (profiles, analytics, notifications).  
- **Monitoring & Ops** → needed before scaling (Sentry, Datadog, backups).  
- **Scale & Enhancements** → only after monitoring is solid (multi‑tenancy, Kubernetes, Zero Trust).  

---

⚡ This flowchart makes it easy to see the **sequential dependencies**: secure first, monetize second, delight users third, protect uptime fourth, scale last.

## 📲 Integrate with Tools

- **Linear** → lightweight issue tracking, perfect for SaaS teams.
- **Notion** → combine Kanban + docs (Ops Handbook + feature roadmap in one workspace).
- **Trello/Jira** → drag‑and‑drop Kanban with automation (move tasks when PR merges).

👉 Integration makes your roadmap actionable and collaborative.

---

## 🔄 Alternate Styles

- **Kanban (ongoing tasks)** → great for ops (backups, monitoring, patching).
- **Timeline/Gantt** → better for feature rollout (Week 1 → Week 5).
- **Milestone board** → high‑level view for founders/investors.

---

# ✅ Outcome

By adapting your roadmap with **milestones, dependencies, and tool integration**, you’ll keep Advvancia **lean, focused, and scalable**.

⚡ You can start simple (Kanban in Notion or Trello) and layer in milestones/dependencies as the project grows.
