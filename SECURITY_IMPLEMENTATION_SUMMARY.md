## 🚨 Critical Findings (Immediate Action)

These issues were identified and need immediate attention:

### 1. Missing Content-Security-Policy Header

**Severity**: HIGH
**Impact**: XSS attacks possible
**Fix**:

```typescript
// backend/src/middleware/security.ts
app.use(
  helmet({
    contentSecurityPolicy: {
      directives: {
        defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
        scriptSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
        styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
        imgSrc: ["'self'", "data:", "https:"],
      },
    },
  }),
);
```

### 2. Rate Limiting Not Enforced on All Endpoints

**Severity**: MEDIUM
**Impact**: Brute force attacks, DoS
**Fix**:

```typescript
// backend/src/index.ts
import rateLimit from "express-rate-limit";

const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000,
  max: 100,
  message: "Too many requests from this IP",
});

app.use("/api/", limiter);
```

### 3. AI Endpoints Vulnerable to Prompt Injection

**Severity**: HIGH
**Impact**: Model manipulation, data leakage
**Fix**: Implement AI safety middleware (see ai-redteam-test.ps1 recommendations)
